# 1. Complexity
## Time
### Constant time operations
If an operation can be completed in a fixed time and this time has nothing to do with the volume of the samples
It's usually represented by O
We only need the highest order item and igore the lower order ones, and no coefficient is needed
If the left-over part is f(N), then the time complexity is O(f(N))
When assesing an algorithm, consider time complexity first, then analyze the actual running time under different data samples, AKA "constant term time"
* Sample
  - constant
`int a = arr[i];`
`+, -, *, /, bit operations`
  - non-constant
`int b = list.get(i);`
