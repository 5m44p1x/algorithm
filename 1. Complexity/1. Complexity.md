# 1. Complexity
## Time
### Constant time operations
If an operation can be completed in a fixed time and this time has nothing to do with the volume of the samples
It's usually represented by O
We only need the highest order item and igore the lower order ones, and no coefficient is needed
If the left-over part is f(N), then the time complexity is O(f(N))
When assesing an algorithm, consider time complexity first, then analyze the actual running time under different data samples, AKA "constant term time"
* Example
  - constant
`int a = arr[i];`
`+, -, *, /, bit operations`
  - non-constant
`int b = list.get(i);`
* Selection sort
Traverse the array in the external loop, where $$i  \epsilon  [0, n - 1)$$
Traverse the array in the internal loop and find the minimum item, where $$j \epsilon [i, n)$$
Swap $$arr[i]$$ and $$arr[min]$$
  - look up: $$N + (N - 1) + (N - 2) + ...$$
  - compare: $$N + (N - 1) + (N - 2) + ...$$
  - swap: N times
  $$= a * N ^ 2 + b * N + c$$
## Space
* Selection, bubble sort
  - time complexity O(N ^ 2), extra space complexity O(1)
* ^ operation
  - 0 ^ N = N        N ^ N = 0
  - a ^ b = b ^ a    a ^ b  ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)
  - swap two values (a and b should not point to the same memory area)
    + a = a ^ b;  // = A ^ B
    + b = a ^ b;  // = A ^ B ^ B = A
    + a = a ^ b;  // = A ^ B ^ A = B
  - Q1: an int array arr[], how to find those odd-time-shown elements, requirement: time complexity O(N), space complexity O(1)
    1. one element shows odd times, all the others show even times
      ```
        int eor = 0;
          for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            eor ^= arr[i];
        }
        return eor;
      ```
    2. two elements show odd times, all the others show even times
* Insertion sort
  - time plexity O(N ^ 2), sometimes can get a higher efficiency than selection and bubble sort
## type of complexity
* $$O(f(N))$$ represents the worst senario
* $$\Theta(f(N))$$ represents the average senario
* $$\Omega(f(N))$$ represents the best senario
